<br>

### Do we share the information we collect with third parties?
We do not share information collected with third parties.

<br>

### Where and when is information collected from customers and end users?
We will collect personal information that you submit to us as described above.

<br>

### How Do We Use Your Email Address?
Your email address will be used as a sign-in method.

<br>

### Could my information be transferred to other countries?
We are incorporated in Canada. Information collected via our website, through direct interactions with you, or from use of our help
services may be transferred from time to time to our offices or personnel, or to third parties, located throughout the world, and may be
viewed and hosted anywhere in the world, including countries that may not have laws of general applicability regulating the use and
transfer of such data. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, by using any of the above, you voluntarily consent to the trans-
border transfer and hosting of such information.

<br>

### Is the information collected through our service secure?
We take precautions to protect the security of your information. We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help
safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your information. However, neither people nor
security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems. In addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail
to follow policies. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute
security. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect your personal information, you agree that intentional
misconduct will be the standards used to measure our compliance with that duty.

<br>

### Can I update or correct my information?
The rights you have to request updates or corrections to the information we collect depend on your relationship with us. Personnel
may update or correct their information as detailed in our internal company employment policies. Customers have the right to request
the restriction of certain uses and disclosures of personally identifiable information as follows. You can contact us in order to (1)
update or correct your personally identifiable information, (2) delete the personally identifiable information maintained about you on our systems (subject to
the following paragraph), by cancelling your account. Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will have no effect on other
information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this privacy policy prior to such
update, correction, change or deletion. To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps (such as requesting a
unique password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining
the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times. You should be aware that it is not technologically possible
to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to us from our system. The need to back up our systems to
protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult
or impossible for us to locate. Promptly after receiving your request, all personal information stored in databases we actively use, and
other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent
reasonably and technically practicable. If you are an end user and wish to update, delete, or receive any information we have about
you, you may do so by contacting the organization of which you are a customer.

<br>

### How Long Do We Keep Your Information?
We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide service to you and fulfill the purposes described in this policy. This is
also the case for anyone that we share your information with and who carries out services on our behalf. When we no longer need to
use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we'll either remove it
from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can't identify you.

<br>

### How do we protect your information?
We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or enter,
submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is
transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be
accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. After
a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) is never kept on file. We cannot,
however, ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to us or guarantee that your information on the
service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial
safeguards.

<br>

### Governing Law
The laws of Canada, excluding its conflicts of law rules, shall govern this agreement and your use of our service. Your use of our
service may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international laws.

<br>

### Your Consent
By using our service, registering an account, or making a purchase, you consent to this privacy policy.

<br>

### Links to Other Websites
This privacy policy applies only to the services. The services may contain links to other websites not operated or controlled by
iLektra. We are not responsible for the content, accuracy or opinions expressed in such websites, and such websites are not
investigated, monitored or checked for accuracy or completeness by us. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the
services to another website, our privacy policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including
those that have a link on our platform, is subject to that website's own rules and policies. Such third parties may use their own
cookies or other methods to collect information about you.

<br>

### Kids' Privacy
We do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under
the age of 13. If You are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal data, please contact
us. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental
consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.

or provide links to third-party websites or services ("Third-Party Services").
You acknowledge and agree that we shall not be responsible for any Third-Party Services, including their accuracy, completeness,
timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality or any other aspect thereof. We do not assume and shall not have
any liability or responsibility to you or any other person or entity for any Third-Party Services.
